Here's an example of a dashboard with pages for customers, orders, and a chart using Chart.js:

Customers Page:

On this page, you can view and manage information related to customers, such as contact details, purchase history, and other relevant information.
Orders Page:

In the orders page, you can see a list of all placed orders, their details, and status. You can also manage orders here by updating their statuses..
Chart:

This chart utilizes the Chart.js library to visualize relevant statistical data. It could represent, for example, sales volume over time, geographical distribution of customers, or any other useful information for analysis and decision-making.
